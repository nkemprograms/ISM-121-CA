                        <p>This is one of my works I am most proud of. <br> It was inspired by a flower vase that I saw sitting next to a lamp.</p>

                        <p>This is one of my more abstract works. <br> It is centered around the human face with shrapnel like figures surrounding it. </p>

                        <p>This was one of my first works. <br> It was just me playing around with colours until something good came out of it.</p>

                        <p>I got inspired for this artwork when I was eating an apple. <br> I thought it was quite poetic and decided to transform it into an masterpiece.</p>

                        <p>I've always thought the human eye was quite artistic in itself. <br> It was only a matter of time before I made a project based of it.</p>

                        <p>This is my most recent work. <br> It was inspired by the hardships and difficulties women face as they approach adulthood.</p>
